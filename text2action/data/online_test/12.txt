HOW TO MAKE BEEF STROGANOFF
Melt 3 tablespoons of butter (or alternately  heat equivalent amount of olive oil) in skillet over medium heat
Increase heat to high and add beef  working in batches if needed
Brown well on each side  but avoid burning
Sprinkle salt and pepper on the beef  then take the meat out of the pan and set aside
In same skillet  add the shallots or onions  and cook for one to two minutes
Allow the shallots to soak up the drippings from the beef
Remove shallots from the pan and move to the same bowl as the beef
Add the remaining 3 tablespoons of butter or olive oil
Add the mushrooms and cook over medium-high heat
Cook for about 4 minutes  stirring occasionally
Sprinkle tarragon and nutmeg onto the mushrooms
Reduce heat and add the sour cream to the mushrooms
Turn to very low heat
Dilute  if needed  with one or two tablespoons of water
Mix thoroughly
Do not allow the mixture to boil or simmer because the sour cream will curdle if it does
Add the beef and shallots
Mix thoroughly so that the beef and mushrooms are well coated with the sauce
Add salt and pepper according to your taste
Beef stroganoff tastes great when served hot over cooked pasta (spaghetti  linguine  or fettuccine)
It's also good with rice or mashed potatoes
Garnish with parsley and parmesan cheese if desired.
