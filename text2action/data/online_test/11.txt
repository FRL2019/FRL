HOW TO MAKE LASAGNE
Heat the saucepan
Add in the meat and cook it in its own fat until it is well browned
Drain most of the fat but not all  we'd recommend you leave around 3 tablespoons of fat as this makes the dish tastier
Add in the onions  garlic  red pepper  salt  and pepper
Stir the meat mixture for a few minutes over medium heat until the onions are soft and translucent
Add a few pinches of oregano and one or two tablespoons of tomato paste  depending on your own taste
If you want to play it safe  it's best to add just one tablespoon
Remember that too much tomato paste can make the mixture very sour
Stir in the canned tomatoes and allow the mixture to boil gently
Cover your pot and let everything simmer on low heat for 45 minutes
Meanwhile  place plenty of water in another pot
Cook the lasagne noodles according to package directions
The lasagne noodles must be soft  or al dente  but not soggy
When the noodles are done  drain them well and separate the noodles from each other
Otherwise  they will tend to stick together and get torn
Set the noodles aside
When sauce mixture is done  add the basil
Mix well and turn off the heat
Preheat the oven to 400F
Place all the ingredients nearby for easier assembly
Ladle just enough sauce to cover the bottom of the baking pan
Place four pieces of lasagne noodles on top of the sauce
If the noodles get torn  piece them together as much as possible
Spread a thin layer each of ricotta  mozzarella  and parmesan cheeses on the noodles
Ladle on more sauce  and continue with the rest of the layers in the same order: sauce  noodles  and cheeses
You should have at least 3 layers of these items
After the third layer  spread a layer of ricotta cheese on top of your creation  then pour on the rest of the sauce
Finally  top everything with all your remaining cheese
Put your tray into the oven and bake for 40 minutes
When your lasagne is done  the top of your lasagne should be lightly brown and the cheese topping should be soft and melted
Allow the lasagne to rest for a few minutes before serving.
