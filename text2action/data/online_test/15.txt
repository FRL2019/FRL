Push the mixture into the baking loaf pan
Then put the loaf into the oven and bake for about an hour
When the meatloaf is done  allow it to cool slightly  then slowly remove the loaf from the baking pan by cutting along the sides with a butter knife
Gently lift the meatloaf from the pan and place on serving plate
