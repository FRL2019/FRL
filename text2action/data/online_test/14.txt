HOW TO MAKE MARGARITAS
If you want salted glasses  prepare your glasses first
Use a lime wedge to moisten the rim of each glass before dipping the outside of the rim into salt
Make sure only the outside of the glass is salted  you don't want salt dropping into your margarita
If you're not sure if your guests want salt or not  only put salt one one-half of the glass rim
Set the glasses aside
Now that your glasses are ready  it's time to make the margarita
Mix the tequila  orange liqueur or triple sec  and lime juice in a cocktail shaker or covered pitcher
Add crushed ice
Shake the mixture really well
Strain the mixture into the cocktail glasses
If you want ice  put ice into the glasses before you pour the margarita
Place a lime wedge on the rim of each cocktail glass
Serve
Of course  you can always raise the amount of the tequila for more buzz  the amount of lime juice for more zing  or the amount of triple sec or liqueur for more sweetness
True margarita does not need sugar  but if you want your margarita sweet  feel free to add sugar  as is often done anyway
The quality of a margarita mix is determined by the quality of the tequila and triple sec used to make the drink
If you want premium margarita  spend on the best bottles of tequila and triple sec
For a slushy version of margarita  crush some ice cubes in an ice crusher and mix that with the drinks
You can also skip the cocktail shaker or covered pitcher  and just mix the liquid ingredients and ice in a blender to get a shake-like consistency
Indulge!
